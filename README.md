## üöÄ Project Overview
Breeze is a Flutter application that demonstrates best practices in Flutter development, focusing on user management with:
- BLoC pattern for state management
- Integration with the [DummyJSON Users API](https://dummyjson.com/users)
- Clean, maintainable, and scalable code structure

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. API Integration

- Infinite scrolling for user list with debouncing
- Real-time search by user name
- Fetches user posts and todos on selection
- Endpoints used:
  - Users: `https://dummyjson.com/users`
  - Posts: `https://dummyjson.com/posts/user/{userId}`
  - Todos: `https://dummyjson.com/todos/user/{userId}`

### 2. BLoC State Management
- Uses `flutter_bloc` for all state management
- Handles loading, success, and error states
- Separate events for fetching, searching, and pagination
- Nested BLoC logic for fetching posts and todos per user
